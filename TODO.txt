Batch convert PNG -> TGA
==========================
"c:\Program Files\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q8\magick.exe" mogrify -path D:\Dump\Icons\Out\Tga -compress RLE -format tga *.png

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
	cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
	cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
	cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Backlog: 
=========
- FDS oscilloscope can assert if you use modulation table to produce very low sound.
- Fix "SeparateChannelsExportTndMode"
- Can we pahse reset N163? Steo mentionned that in very low note, he notices that the waveform starts from the middle.
- S5B is 1 octave off. Periods are 12 bits, so technically can do lower, but we still bottom at A0???
- Shy mode on mobile?
- Max song length is still 256, bump that to 1024 at least.
- Linux : new openal+ smarter detection. Need a way to try the OS one + my one if it fails.
- BUG : Quit menu doesnt nothing on MacOS
- BUG : VRC7 doesnt respect release point on volume envelope (its a "custom release" so it ignores it... Ugh) EPSM probably too.
- Weird shift when using an external display with different scaling (ex: 100% vs 150%)
- Add effect to select N163 wave. How does it react in FT.
- Full range volume for expansions?
- Different aspect ratios for video export?
- Improve linux file dialog (Steo feedback)
- Hold SHIFT+click for multiple delete.
- Improve expansion tooltips.
- Idea from perkka "When an instrument is selected. Have the channels thats not supported by it slightly faded out, or the channel names that support it in bold or something"
- Do a pass on tooltips for ParamProviders.
- Way to convert instrument between expansions.
- Left resize to preserve release position?
- Full S5B support? Not very intersting... Noise + envelopes. Meuh.
- Display number of selected channels in grid for video export?
- Dark mode for open/save dialogs on MacOS? + title bar?
- BUG : Drag single pattern (with one note covring the entire pattern) from 1 channel to the other while its playing, the old note keeps playing and adds on top.
- BUG : "theres a bug where when you select a pattern multiple times and you try to change a note, the change is multiplied by the # of patterns you selected", see video.
- Reorder channels for video export.
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Alphabetical ordering should be a bit smarter about numbers.
- Sound output selection?
- Give better names to auto saves
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Volume/effect scaling, easy one we have context menus.
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- ffmpeg path on Linux should work on path (Puna on CC discord).
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- C0 is hidden in piano roll video
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHÄ€KRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Dont reset camera in piano roll when deleting instrument (probably to handle case where you were editing the instrument)
- Improve no-attack.
	- Allow disabling attacks if all envelopes of both instruments are exactly the same.
	- Draw attack as red if user makes a mistake.
- Wayland support on Linux (GLFW supports it). Standard file dialogs.
